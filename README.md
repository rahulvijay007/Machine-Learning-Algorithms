# Iris Dataset Analysis and Classification

This repository contains code for analyzing the Iris dataset and performing classification using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, modeling, and hyperparameter optimization.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains information about various attributes of Iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.

## Scripts

### Script 1: Decision Trees

#### Description
- Loads the Iris dataset
- Performs data analysis and preprocessing
- Visualizes the dataset using pair plots and heatmaps
- Builds a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluates the classifier using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Performs cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization

### Script 2: Random Forest

#### Description
- Similar to Script 1 but uses a Random Forest classifier
- Performs the same steps as in Script 1 for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Compares the performance of the Random Forest classifier with Decision Trees

## Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and converting categorical variables
- EDA using pair plots, heatmaps, and bar plots
- Classification using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms
- Evaluation of classification models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance

## Dependencies
- pandas
- seaborn
