## Introduction
Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. In this example, we use the AgglomerativeClustering algorithm to perform hierarchical clustering on an artificial dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/hierarchical-clustering-example.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and visualize the hierarchical clustering process.

## Dataset
An artificial dataset is created using the `make_blobs` function from `sklearn.datasets`. This dataset consists of randomly generated blobs with three clusters.

## Analysis
The code begins by importing necessary libraries and creating the artificial dataset. It then performs hierarchical clustering using AgglomerativeClustering and visualizes the results with a dendrogram and scatter plot.

## Results
The scatter plot demonstrates the clusters identified by hierarchical clustering. Each cluster is represented by a different color.
