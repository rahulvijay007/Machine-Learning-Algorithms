# MPG Analysis and Linear Regression Modeling

This repository contains code for analyzing and modeling data related to vehicle fuel efficiency using the MPG dataset. Two separate scripts are provided, each performing similar analyses but presenting different visualizations.

## Script 1: Analysis and Modeling Script 1

### Description
This script loads the MPG dataset, performs data analysis, data preprocessing, and univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. It also includes linear regression modeling to predict fuel efficiency.

### Usage
Execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. Follow the instructions and comments provided within the script for step-by-step execution.

### Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values
- Univariate analysis using count plots and histograms
- Bivariate analysis using box plots and scatter plots
- Multivariate analysis using scatter plots with regression lines
- Linear regression modeling to predict fuel efficiency
- Evaluation of the regression model using metrics and visualizations

### Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- yellowbrick

### Dataset
The dataset used in this script is the MPG dataset, containing information about vehicle fuel efficiency.

## Script 2: Analysis and Modeling Script 2

### Description
This script also loads the MPG dataset and performs similar analyses as described above. However, it may present different visualizations or insights compared to Script 1.

### Usage
Execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. Follow the instructions and comments provided within the script for step-by-step execution.

### Features
- Similar features as Script 1

### Dependencies
- Similar dependencies as Script 1

### Dataset
The same MPG dataset is used in this script.
