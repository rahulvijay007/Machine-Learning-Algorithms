## Introduction
This code demonstrates how to use the KNN algorithm to classify telecommunications customers based on various features such as tenure, age, address, and income. It also includes hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/telecom-customer-classification.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook to run the code and follow along with the analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and hyperparameter optimization steps.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `teleCust1000t.csv`, containing information about telecommunications customers.

## Analysis
The code begins by loading the dataset and analyzing its structure and distribution to gain insights into the data.

## Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include dropping unnecessary columns, performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and standardizing numerical variables.

## Modeling
The KNN algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data to build classification models. The code demonstrates how to train, test, and evaluate the models.

## Hyperparameter Optimization
GridSearchCV is utilized for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal values for the KNN algorithm's parameters.

## Results
The results section reports the accuracy scores of the KNN models before and after hyperparameter optimization.
