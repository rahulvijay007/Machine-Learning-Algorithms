# Digit Dataset Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction

This repository contains code for analyzing the digit dataset and performing dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Description
The script loads the digit dataset, performs data analysis, and applies PCA for dimensionality reduction. It demonstrates how to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.

## Usage
Execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. Follow the instructions and comments provided within the script for step-by-step execution.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration using the digits dataset
- Pre-modelling steps including standardization of data
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA with two components and four components
- Visualization of principal components
- Analysis of explained variance and cumulative explained variance

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this script is the digit dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets.
